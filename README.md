# SAT-solver-algorithms
This project contains Python implementations of three SAT-solving algorithms: Resolution, Davis-Putnam (DP), and Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL).
How to Run
1. Open the Python file for the algorithm you want to test (resolution.py, dp.py, or dpll.py).
2. Press Run to start the program.
3. When prompted in the console, enter a number from 1 to 11 to select which input file (input1.cnf, input2.cnf, ..., input11.cnf) you want to run.
